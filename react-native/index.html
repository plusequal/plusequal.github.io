                    <h3>Workshop Overview</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>All of our += workshops follow the same format. An opening presentation from a company that has implemented the technology, telling us about the wins and losses they faced transitioning or implementing the new technology. Followed by a talk on the technology itself, curated to inspire you on what you can create and do with the technology, showcase its power. Finally, an afternoon workshop where the teacher(s) will show you what we will create, walk you through creating it, then leave you to expand on your creation with them available to help.</p>

                    <h3>Workshop 1pm - 4pm</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>The Workshop portion is designed to give you the foundations of mobile app development using exciting technologies like React Native, Redux, Firebase, Third Party APIs and more. The skills that you will learn in this workshop can help you pursue the app idea you’ve dreamt of building, stay up to date on the newest mobile technologies, or impress your tech friends by releasing IOS and Android app simultaneously with minimal effort.</p>

                  <p>In this workshop, you will be guided through the process of building a personalized gif based curation app with data from everyone's favorite gif source — Giphy ! You will be implementing React Native to build the Interface (Views), Redux to handle the data flow, GIPHY API as your data source and integrate with Firebase as your persistent store to keep track of your likes and dislikes for the years to come.</p>
